Assests Used:
Maglev Plugin & Samples
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DpBf-4rQKmEU4eEcK1OF5EieOcSDoTHR/view  <- Unreal engine 4.21 plugin build + binaries (builds just fine on 4.25.3)
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B20tIRBAcOlsR244UXNKR1J3ME0/view  <- Sample project (Track static mesh came from here)

Mode:
Racing

Issues:
Cannot package a Demo as the UE4 cannot seem to find /Script/Maglev and that script has all the hover components in it.
Currently trying to find out why the builder cannot find the file as it has never moved and the editor plays just fine....
